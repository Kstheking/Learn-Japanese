# Hiragana Characters

Hiragana is a Japanese syllabary, one component of the Japanese writing system, along with katakana, kanji, and in some cases rōmaji (Latin script). It is a phonetic lettering system. The word hiragana literally means "ordinary" or "simple" kana ("simple" originally as contrasted with kanji).

Hiragana and katakana are both kana systems. With one or two minor exceptions, each sound in the Japanese language  is represented by one character (or one digraph) in each system. This may be either a vowel such as "a" (hiragana あ); a consonant followed by a vowel such as "ka" (か); or "n" (ん), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context, sounds either like English m, n, or ng ([ŋ]), or like the nasal vowels of French.
By learning hiragana, you will learn the basics of Japanese pronunciation.

**Notes** 
Each Hiragana letter represents particular syllable. Letter itself has no meaning.
Hiragana is used widely to form a sentence.

Hiragana was developed in the 8-10th century by simplifying the form of particular Kanji symbols. Compared to Katakana, Hiragana letters have more curved lines.
